# Subanser
A simple Python Script you must take a Try !

# What is Subanser !
I have created a simple python script which will help you in checking if the subdomain is available or not if you have a big bunch of subdomain such as 500 or something it is hard to manually go and check if it's available or not.
# How To use it ?
- Get all the subdomains of the target you need to check
- Give it a name for example:-sample.txt
- Git clone the repo
- Copy the file sample.txt to cloned folder here Subanser
- bash:- python3 subanser.py
- (Here I have attached a sample.txt containing some domains you can edit with your file or subdomains).
